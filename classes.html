        <p>This course examines the design and implementation of web applications with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Flask and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on
          projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive user interfaces (UIs), and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By semester's end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in the principles, languages, and
          tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the internet.</p>

        <p>Today we all live and work in a participatory cyberspace. Computers, the data networks that interconnect them, and the services available over the networks make up this cyberspace. As cyberspace invades almost all areas of modern day
          living, playing, and working, it is becoming more important that people understand its technical and political underpinnings and operations, as well as its capabilities, threats, and weaknesses. This is a companion course to CSCI E-45b. The
          goal of this pair of courses is to give students the tools they need to understand, use, and manage the technologies involved, as well as the ability to appreciate the legal, social, and political dynamics of this ever expanding universe
          and the interplay between the cyber and physical worlds. The pair of courses covers the essential elements of computing and the history, structure, operation, and governance of the internet. This course focuses on the fundamental workings
          of the digital world. From individual computing devices to the broader internet, students learn how each piece in this gigantic puzzle comes together to create the digital infrastructure that is the cyberspace of today and tomorrow. In
          addition, we explore the fundamental concepts, technologies, and issues associated with managing and securing cyberspace.
